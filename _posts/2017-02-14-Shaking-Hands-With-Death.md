> It is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die. That is true, it's called Life.

<cite>Terry Pratchett</cite> --- The Last Continent, 1998

Last night I watched the BBC documentary, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08fjlvx" target="_blank">Back In Black</a> which is about the life of Terry Pratchett. I've always admired his was with words and the quote I've included above always makes me think.

It's an excellent documentary, although terribly sad. Especially the moments with Neil Gaiman speaking about his friend. 

> There is a fury to Terry Pratchett's writing: ... anger at pompous critics, and at those who think serious is the opposite of funny; ... I rage at the imminent loss of my friend. And I think, "What would Terry do with this anger?" Then I pick up my pen, and I start to write.
