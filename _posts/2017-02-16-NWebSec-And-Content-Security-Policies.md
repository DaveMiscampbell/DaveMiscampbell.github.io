Today I stumbled across an excellent open source library called <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NWebsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NWebSec</a>

Basically, the main goal of the project is to make setting Security Headers in ASP.NET applications super easy.

And it is. The NuGet package adds a bunch of things to your web.config and then the docs at <a href="http://docs.nwebsec.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://docs.nwebsec.com</a> explain everything super clearly.

If you're in need of this, it's so much easier than doing everything by hand.

Thanks to the guys <a href="https://twitter.com/NWebsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@NWebSec</a> for creating such a great library.

Route to finding this library:
1. Google "<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=content+security+policy+troy+hunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Security Policy Troy Hunt</a>"
2. Visit <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/implementing-content-security-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt's blog</a>
